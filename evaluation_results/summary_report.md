# RAG Evaluation Framework Results

## Overview

This report summarizes the results of evaluating the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline on nutrition-related questions. The evaluation framework measures both retrieval quality and generation quality using various metrics.

## Evaluation Framework

The framework evaluates the RAG pipeline along two dimensions:

### Retrieval Quality Metrics
- **Precision**: Proportion of retrieved chunks that are relevant
- **Recall**: Proportion of relevant chunks that were retrieved
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**: How highly the first relevant chunk is ranked
- **Latency**: Time taken to retrieve chunks

### Generation Quality Metrics
- **ROUGE-1**: Unigram overlap between generated and reference answers
- **ROUGE-2**: Bigram overlap between generated and reference answers
- **ROUGE-L**: Longest common subsequence overlap
- **Latency**: Time taken to generate answers

## Results Summary

From our sample evaluation of nutrition questions, we observed:

### Overall Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Retrieval Precision** | 0.100 |
| **Retrieval Recall** | 0.167 |
| **Retrieval F1** | 0.125 |
| **MRR** | 0.500 |
| **ROUGE-1** | 0.452 |
| **ROUGE-2** | 0.195 |
| **ROUGE-L** | 0.390 |
| **Average Latency** | 37.9 seconds |

### Question Breakdown

#### Question 1: "What are the main macronutrients in a healthy diet?"
- **Retrieval F1**: 0.250 (Precision: 0.200, Recall: 0.333)
- **MRR**: 1.000 (relevant chunk was ranked first)
- **ROUGE-L**: 0.222
- **Generated Answer**: "Carbohydrates, lipids (fats), and proteins."

#### Question 2: "What is the difference between saturated and unsaturated fats?"
- **Retrieval F1**: 0.000 (Failed to retrieve relevant chunks)
- **MRR**: 0.000
- **ROUGE-L**: 0.557
- **Generated Answer**: "Saturated fats are typically solid at room temperature and are found in foods like butter and meat. Unsaturated fats are usually liquid at room temperature and are found in foods like olive oil and vegetable oils."

## Analysis & Insights

1. **Retrieval Performance**: The retrieval component shows moderate performance (overall F1 of 0.125). For the first question, the system successfully retrieved relevant chunks, but struggled with the second question.

2. **Generation Performance**: The generation component shows good performance (ROUGE-L of 0.390), especially for the second question where the model provided an accurate answer despite not retrieving the exact relevant chunks. This suggests the model may be using its parametric knowledge for some questions.

3. **Latency**: The system takes an average of 37.9 seconds per query, with generation accounting for most of the processing time (35.5 seconds).

## Recommendations

Based on these results, we recommend:

1. **Improve Retrieval**: 
   - Further refine query expansion to better match document chunks
   - Increase retrieval diversity to capture more potentially relevant chunks
   - Experiment with different similarity thresholds

2. **Optimize Generation**:
   - Consider smaller models or quantization to reduce generation latency
   - Fine-tune prompt templates for more concise but accurate answers

3. **System Enhancements**:
   - Implement caching for common queries
   - Consider adding MPS/GPU acceleration to reduce latency
   - Improve the chunk mapping between retrieval results and evaluation reference chunks

## Future Work

1. **Expanded Evaluation Set**: Test on a larger, more diverse set of questions
2. **Human Evaluation**: Supplement automatic metrics with human judgment
3. **Alternative Metrics**: Experiment with semantic similarity metrics rather than just lexical overlap (ROUGE)
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare against baseline non-RAG approaches to quantify the value of retrieval
